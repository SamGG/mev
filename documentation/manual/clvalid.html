<h3>CLVALID: Cluster Validation</h3>
	<p>CLVALID is technique for evaluating unsupervised clustering techniques.  
	Given the large number of clustering methods available to researchers, this module aims to evaluate the technique most appropriate for the data.  
	CLVALID uses the R package "clValid" to compare the relative properties of 10 different clustering methods across a several different numbers of clusters.
	This module aims to help choose a method that is most compact, well-separated, connected, and stable.  
	It also makes use of bioconductor annotation packages to biologically validate the results.  	<div class="screenshots ">

				</div>-The user must first choose whether the clustering validation is to occur over samples or genes.  Please note that large datasets (typically over 10,000 genes) may result in memory issues. <br><br>
				If clustering a dataset with a large number of genes, you may instead choose to run the analysis on a smaller subset of your genes.  
				To do this, you must first create an MeV cluster using the Cluster Manager or other method.  
				-Once created, the "Perform Analysis on MeV Cluster" checkbox will be enabled.  Click this and select the desired cluster using the Cluster Browser.<br><br>
				-Next, select the number of clusters involved in your analysis.  The maximum cluster range is 2-6 clusters.<br><br>
				-Next, choose at least ONE type of validation.  See below for a summary of validation types.  If you are running biological validation, your data must contain an annotation field for "PROBE_ID" and you must select the appropriate Bioconductor annotation package from the drop-down menu.<br><br>
				-Finally, select at least ONE clustering method and distance metric.  This module allows for the use of 10 different methods, of which HCL, KMC, SOTA and SOM are currently available for further exploration in MeV.
				(If running HCL or AGNES, you must also select a linkage method.)

<p><em>Hierarchical Clustering </em></p>	
			<p>This check box selects whether to perform hierarchical clustering on the elements in each cluster created</p>
<p>In addition to the standard viewers, this module outputs gene-specific statistics under the “F-Ratio Information” tab, as shown below. These tables can be saved as tab-delimited text files by right-clicking on them. All the columns in the tables can be sorted in ascending or descending order. Clicking on a column header re-orders the rows in ascending order of the values in the selected column. Holding down the SHIFT key while clicking on the column header will re-order the rows in the descending order of that column. Holding down the CTRL key while clicking anywhere on the header will restore the original ordering.</p>
