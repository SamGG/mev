	<h1>Identifier List Import Dialog</h1> <h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<p> The List Import Dialog is used to import gene or experiment identifiers for the
purpose of imposing or creating clusters within the loaded data set.  This enables the
user to mark genes or experiments of interest for tracking during analysis.</p>

<h2>Import ID Type</h2>
This drop down list contains the gene or experiment annotation types in the loaded data set.
Select the annotation type that corresponds to the input ID list.
<br>
<h2>Paste List (Text Area)</h2>
Paste the ID list into the text area by left clicking the mouse in the text area
and then using the ctrl-v key strokes to paste the identifiers in the list.
Reset will clear the selections on the dialog.
<br>
Once the dialog is dismissed, if genes or experiments were found in the data set that
match the input parameters, a cluster attributes dialog will be presented to collect
cluster attributes including the desired cluster color.
