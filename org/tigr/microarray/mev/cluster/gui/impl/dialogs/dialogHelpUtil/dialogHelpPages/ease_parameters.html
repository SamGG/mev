	<h1>EASE: Annotation Over-representation Analysis</h1> <h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>


<h2>Mode Selection</h2>
<h3>Cluster Analysis</h3> 
This mode performs annotation analysis on a selected subset (sample list or cluster) of the
full data set loaded in MeV.  The output is a list of biological 'themes' represented in
the cluster and a statistic reporting the probability that a particular theme is over represented in
the cluster relative to it's representation in the entire data set.  The resulting table will
initially be sorted by this statistic.

<h3>Slide Annotation Survey</h3>
The survey mode simply produces a list of biological themes that are represented in the slide.
The initial ordering of the output table is based on the prevalence of a theme in the data set (hit count).
This mode can be used to cluster genes based on biological themes.  The clusters can then be
stored and marked (colored) for tracking during cluster analysis.

<h2>Parameter Pages</h2>
Several parameter input pages are available:

<br>
<h2>Cluster Browser Page</h2>
This panel displays gene clusters currently stored in MeV's cluster repository.  If no clusters have
been saved then a blank browser page will be displayed and the Cluster Analysis mode option will be
disabled.  Selecting a row in the cluster table will display the cluster in the expression graph area
of the browser.  EASE cluster analysis will operate on the selected cluster.

<h2>Annotation Parameters Page</h2>
This page has three major parts described below.
<h3>MeV Annotation Key</h3>
This area contains a drop down list which contains a list of available annotation types which can be
used identify genes.  Generally it's best to use an index or accession which 'uniquely' identifies
the spotted material.
<h3>Annotation Conversion File</h3>
This optional file provides the mapping from your annotation key (above) to the index used to map to
biological themes (GO terms, KEGG pathways, etc.).  If your annotation key type is the one used in the
linking file (below) then this conversion (mapping) is not needed.
<h3>Gene Annotation / Gene Ontology Linking Files</h3>
This section allows one to specify one or more annotation files.  These files contain gene indices
paired with biological themes such as go terms.   
<h3><i>File Selection Scenario</h3>
One possible example of the file linking structure could be:<br>
<b>[GenBank#]-->[GenBank#]:[locus_link_id]-->[locus_link_id]:[go_term]</b><br>
This shows the progression from 'Annotation Key', to conversion file (converting GenBank# to locus_link_id),
to final linking with GO terms.  Keep in mind that although shown with a single arrow, in general
one gene index will map to many GO terms (or other biological theme or pathway categories).</i>

<h2>Statistical Parameters Page</h2>
Several sections on this page are used to specify reported statistical and result trimming parameters.
<h2>Reported Statistic</h2>
<h3>Fisher's Exact Probability</h3>
The Fisher's Exact Probability reports the probability that a biological theme is
over-represented in the cluster of interest relative to the representation of that theme in the
total gene population. For example, suppose that one has a gene
list of 50 genes from a population of 10,000 genes.  Now suppose that 10 of the 50 genes were related to
pathway "A" but only 13 genes in the total population were associated with pathway "A".  This scenario
would yield a low probability that the observed number of hits (occurrences of pathway "A") within the small 
sample could be due to chance alone.  This statistic is based on the hypergeometric distribution and has
benefits over chi-square in that it is appropriate for finite populations.  The reference sited for EASE
describes this statistic at length.
<h3>EASE Score</h3>
The EASE Score reported is essentially a jackknifed Fisher's Exact Probability which is arrived at
by calculation of the Fisher's Exact where one occurrence (list hit for a term) has been removed.
<h2>Multiplicity Corrections</h2>
Several p-value corrections can be applied to help correct for the chance of arriving at a significant
result when performing multiple tests.
<h3>Bonferroni Correction</h3>
This correction simply multiplies the statistic by the number of results generated.  This is the most
stringent correction of the three options.
<h3>Bonferroni Step Down Correction</h3>
This modified Bonferroni correction ranks the results by the statistic in ascending order.  Each
value is multiplied by (n-rank) where n is the number of results.  In the case of a tie, where two
results have the same probability the rank is kept constant until the next element occurs having
a higher probability value.  The rank is then adjusted for the number of tied elements where rank was constant.
<h3>Sidak Method</h3>
This correction uses the following formula where v' is the corrected value and k is the rank of the result
in terms of original statistic value.  In this case ties in rank are handled as described in the step down Bonferroni correction.
<br>
v' = 1-(1-v)<sup>k</sup>

<h3>Permutation Analysis</h3>
The permutation option performs a number of bootstrapping iterations where random
gene lists are generated and run through the analysis.  The results are used to apply a correction
factor to the reported statistic.

<h2>Trim Parameters</h2>
The trim parameters can be applied to filter analysis results based on the number of hits
or the fraction of genes in the cluster that are represented by an annotation term.  Sometimes
a term can be found significant but does not represent a large segment of the cluster of interest.
These options can be applied to be certain that a minimum number of genes in the cluster fall under
that particular annotation class.  This feature should be used with caution so that biological
themes represented by very few genes are not excluded.
