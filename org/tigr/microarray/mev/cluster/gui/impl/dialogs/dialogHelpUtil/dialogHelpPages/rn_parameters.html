	<h1>RN: Relevance Networks</h1><h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Sample Selection </h2>
The sample selection option indicates whether to cluster genes or experiments.
<br>

<h2>Use Permutation Test</h2>
This check box is used to indicate that the minimum threshold R^2 value should be
selected based on a distribution constructed from element to element R^2 values
derived following permutation of the expression vectors.
<br>

<h2>Min Threshold</h2> 
This value ranging from 0 to 1.0 indicates
the smallest R^2 possible between two elements to permit a link between the
elements in a subnet.
<br>

<h2>Max Threshold</h2> 
This value ranging from 0 to 1.0 indicates
the greatest R^2 possible between two elements to permit a link between the
elements in a subnet.
<br>

<h2>Use Filter</h2> 
This option allows the user to filter out elements with little dynamic change thus
removing flat or uninteresting elements.  
A measure of entropy is used to rank the elements.  The percentage value
entered (1 to 100) indicates what percentage of the elements to retain
for the construction of the network.  A value of 25 will retain the 25%
of elements having the greatest entropy.
