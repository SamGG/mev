<h2> Result List </h2>
The Result Selection dialog permits one to select from a list of
clustering results.  The results are presented as a list containing
the result node names found on the analysis result tree.  Note that
depending on the context from which the dialog was launched the list
may be a subset of current results which are deemed appropriate for
use.
