	<h1>GDM: Setting the Color Range</h1> <h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>
This dialog controls the range over which distances will be differentially colored
based on the color gradient selected.  e.g. if the range is black to red in color and
the range limits are 0.1 (lower limit) to 0.5 (upper limit), all distances below 0.1
will be represented by black, all distances above 0.5 will be represented by red,
and distances within the range will be represented by a color corresponding to their
position on the color gradient.  The distances outside of the defined range are
said to be saturated (in terms of color representation).  The Dynamic Range Preview
panel clearly represents the current limits applied to the matrix.
<h2>Lower Limit</h2>
The lower range limit defines the distance below which distances will be uniformly
represented by the lower extreme color of the gradient.  This value must be in the
range [0,1) and be less than the upper limit.
<h2>Upper Limit</h2>
The upper range limit defines the distance above which distances will be uniformly
represented by the upper extreme color of the gradient.  This value must be in the
range of (0,1] and be greater than the lower limit.
<h2>% Saturation</h2>
The percent saturation value represents the number of matrix elements which fall
outside of the current range.  Note that this field is only updated upon hitting
the 'Preview' button.
<h2>Effective Range Preview</h2>
This color gradient displays the current limits. (Initial values or entered values
after hitting the 'preview' button.
<h2>Button</h2>
<h3>OK Button</h3>
This button closes the dialog and applies the entered limits on the GDM.
<h3>Cancel Button</h3>
This button closes the dialog and restores the GDM to the state before the range dialog
was opened.
<h3>Reset Button</h3>
This button sets the limit values to the initial limit values displayed upon opening
the dialog.  The restored limits are then previewed on the GDM and in the Range Preview
area of the dialog.
