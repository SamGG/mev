	<h1>GSH: Gene Shaving </h1>
        <h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Sample Selection </h2>
The sample selection option indicates whether to cluster genes or experiments.
<br>
<h2>Number of Clusters</h2>
This integer value indicates the number of clusters to produce.  Note that in
the GSH algorithm the clusters do not necessarily represent disjoint sets. Some
elements may be represented in more than one cluster while other elements may not
be represented at all.
<br>
<h2>Number of Permuted Matrices</h2>
This integer value indicates the number of permuted matrices used to generate an average R<sup>2</sup> (measure 
of cluster variance) used to generate the gap statistic.
<br>
<h2>Number of Permutations/Matrix</h2>
This integer value represents the number of alterations to each permuted matrix produced
to generate the gap statistic.
<br>
<h2> Hierarchical Clustering </h2>
This check box selects whether to perform hierarchical clustering on the elements in each cluster
created.
