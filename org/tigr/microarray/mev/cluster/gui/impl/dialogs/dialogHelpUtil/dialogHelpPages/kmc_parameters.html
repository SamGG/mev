	<h1>KMC: K-Means/K-Medians</h1> <h2> Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Sample Selection </h2>
The sample selection option indicates whether to cluster genes or experiments.
<br>

<h2>Means/Medians option</h2>
The Means or Medians option indicates whether each cluster's centroid vector
should be calculated a mean or a median of the member expression patterns.
<br>

<h2> Number of Clusters </h2>
This positive integer value indicates the number of clusters to be created.
Note that FOM can be used to estimate an appropriate value.
<br>

<h2> Number of Iterations </h2>
This positive integer value is the maximum number of times that all the elements in the data set
will be tested for cluster fit.  On each iteration each element
is associated with the cluster with the closest mean (or median).
<br><br>
Note that the algorithm will terminate when either no elements
require migration (reassignment) to new clusters or when the maximum number of
iterations has been reached.
<br>

<h2> Hierarchical Clustering </h2>
This check box selects whether to perform hierarchical clustering on the elements in each cluster
created.
