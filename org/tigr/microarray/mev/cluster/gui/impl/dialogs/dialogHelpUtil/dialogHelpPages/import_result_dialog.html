	<h1>Import Result Report</h1>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2>Overview</h2>
This dialog reports the result of an identifier list import.  The number of identifiers
that had matching elements (gene or samples) in the data set, a list of those matching
elements, a list of identifiers that were found, and a list of identifiers that were
not found are all reported.
<br>

<h2> Genes or Samples Matched Panel </h2>
This top area of the window reports the number of identifiers matches and provides a
table listing all matching elements.  This section also provides button shortcuts to
select all or clear the selected elements in the table.  Note that the <i>Store Cluster</i>
button will store the selected indices as a cluster.
<br>

<h2>Matching Results</h2>
Two lists are provided to account for all input identifiers.  The list segregates the
input identifiers into those that had matches in the data set and a separate list for
those identifiers not found to match elements in the data set.
<br>

<h2>A Note on the Results</h2>
It can be the case that the resulting list size might not match the number of identifiers
entered.  It might be that some identifiers didn't match an element in the input data or
it can be the case that there were multiple genes in the data set that matched a
particular identifier.
