        <h2>Bridge</h2>
       The bridge package consists of several functions for testing for differential expression 
       among multiple samples. 
		
		<h2>Data Type</h2>
		The type of data that was loaded
		<br><br>
		If the data is affy, but was not loaded through the affy loader, choose "Intensity Data".  This is 
		allows users to export Affy data from GCOS or GCRMA as text files and load them into MeV.
		<br><br>

		<h2> Experiment Labeling </h2>
		Each slide (experiment or hyb) loaded into MeV is listed here.  You must tell Rama how you've 
		labeled your samples.
		<br><br>
		If you've loaded 2 color data, you are asked to indicate which color ( Cy3 or Cy5 ) dye was 
		used on your control samples. It is assumed that the other was used for the treated sample 
		on that slide.  Bridge will infer from the labeling whether or not your experiment was dye-swapped 
		based on your input here.  Keep in mind that Rama requires at least 2 of any color data.
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Advanced Parameters</h2>
		# Iterations ( B ) - the number of iterations used by Bridge
		<br><br>
		Burn In Period ( num.iter ) - the length of the burn-in period in the MCMC algorithm.  This 
		should be less than # Iterations ( B )
		<br><br>
		
		<h2>Rserve</h2>
		This implementation has been built allow the user to connect to any Rserve daemon.  Upon 
		load, the pull down menu is populated with the connection strings from the config file 
		( config/tmev.cfg ).  The user can add a new connection string here if desired.  
		<br><br>
		The format is: ipaddress:port.
		<br><br>
		For example, if the server running Rserve is at IP address 192.168.0.1 and 
		Rserve is running on its default port ( 6311 ), the connection string would be 192.168.0.1:6311.  
		The user can type that into the text field, click add, make sure it is selected in the pull down 
		menu and then run Bridge.  If the connection was made without any errors, the new connection 
		string will be added automatically to the config file.  Of course, the user always has the option 
		of manually adding/editing the connection strings in the config file.
