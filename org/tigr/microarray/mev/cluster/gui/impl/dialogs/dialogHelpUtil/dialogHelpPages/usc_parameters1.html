			<h2> Enter all Class Labels </h2>
			Enter the labels for each of the classes that are in your training set.  If there are more than 2 classes, 
			click the Up Arrow of the '# of Classes' spinner.  Be advised that you should be entering each and every 
			unique class label here.  You will be asked later to assign these labels to your known training hybs.
			<br>
			
			<h2>Analysis Options</h2>
			The USC algorithm works performing through two main processes - training and classification.
			One can elect to perform training (with the built in option of classification afterwords) or classification only.
			<br><br>
			The 'Training & Classify' option results in specific 'Delta' and 'Rho' values along with 'Training Ratios' 
			which can stored as a file and used for classification at a later time.
			<br><br>
			The 'Classification Only' option takes a file input of ratios, delta and rho generated from training and 
			results in a classification of the elements.
			<br><br>
			
			<h2> Advanced Parameters </h2>
			# Folds refers to the # of times one would like 'Random Permutations' to occur during cross validation.  
			For example, if there are 10 training hybs, and # Folds is set to 5, 2 hybs will be removed and used as 
			the 'test subset' during each Fold.  After 5 folds, all 10 hybs will have been removed and used in the 
			'test subset' once.
			<br><br>
			#CV Runs is how many times one would like to run cross validation.
			<br><br>
			# Bins is the # of Delta values that one would like to try during cross validation.  For example, if 'Max Delta' 
			is 20 and '# Bins' is 50, the Delta values would range from 0 - 20 by increments of 0.4 (20 / 50 = 0.4).  
			Delta = { 0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2... 20 }.
			<br><br>
			Max Delta is the maximum Delta (Shrinkage) value to use during cross validation.
			<br><br>
			Corr Low and Corr High are the minimum and maximum values one would like to try as a Correlation Threshold value.  
			When the correlation between 2 genes is greater than this value, 1 of the genes will 
			be removed from analysis.
			<br><br>
			Corr Step is the increment by which one would like to step between 'Corr Low' and 'Corr High'.  By default, 
			cross validation will occur using the set Correlation Threshold = { 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 }.
