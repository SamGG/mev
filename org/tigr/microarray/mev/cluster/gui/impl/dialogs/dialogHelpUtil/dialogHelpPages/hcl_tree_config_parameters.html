<h2> Distance Threshold </h2>
This floating point parameter indicates the smallest distance
that will be represented on the tree.  If a node distance
falls below this threshold the representation for that node
will have a height of zero.  Using this option one can essentially
combine low level elements that are very close together to appear
as members of a single node.
<br>
<h2> Minimum Pixel Distance </h2>
This integer is the minimum height of a node in the tree in units of pixels.
Nodes which are close and would ordinarily have a node height below
this value are forced to appear this number of pixels above the
lower level node.
<br>
<h2> Maximum Pixel Distance </h2>
Maximum Pixel Distance (integer) is the maximum distance that any node can have.
Nodes which are distant and would ordinarily have a node height greater
than this value are constrained to appear this number of pixels above the
lower level node.
