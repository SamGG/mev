	<h1>Search Result Report</h1>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Genes or Samples Found Panel </h2>
This top area of the window reports the number of search matches and provides a
table listing all matching elements.  This section also provides button shortcuts to
select all or clear the selected elements in the table.  The <i>Store Cluster</i> button
saves the selected elements as a cluster and assigns a color to mark the selected
elements (genes or samples).  As always the marking of genes or samples can aid
in tracking these elements during analysis.  The <i>Update Shortcut</i> button provides
a new Search Result window with updated viewer shortcuts (described below) that
correspond to only the selected elements in the initial search.  Note that by
selecting subsets of the results and updating the search result report you can hone in on
very specific subsets of elements.

<h2>Viewer Shortcuts</h2>
The <i>Viewer Shortcuts</i> section provides a means to jump to cluster viewers containing the elements
matching the search criteria found in the result table.  The tree structure on the left
lists analysis results that contain some or all of the matching genes or samples.
Click on the analysis of interest within this panel to update a list of Expression
and Table Viewers containing the elements.  Selecting viewers from the <i>Experiment Viewers</i>
or <i>Table Viewers</i> list causes the main display of MeV to jump to the selected cluster viewer.
This is an important feature to help track specific genes or samples.
