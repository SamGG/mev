	<h1>Script Error Log</h1>
            <hr size = 10>

The Script Error Log records and reports errors during script validation.
These errors fall into two basic categories.<br><br>
 
<i>Parse Errors</i> describe
problems with script construction and can be described as <i>Fatal Errors</i>
(malformed XML) such as missing closing tags, <i>Validation Errors</i> in which the script fails
to conform the the DTD (Document Type Description), and <i>Parse Warnings</i>.  <br><br>

Aside from Parse Errors, the other major error type is in parameter validation,
 <i>Parameter Errors</i>.  These errors report missing parameters, parameter type
mismatches, and parameters that fall outside of established range constraints.
<br><br>
The <i>Edit Script</i> button will display the current script in an editor window
to the right of the reported error tables.  If corrections are made to the script it is
possible to right click to save the corrected script to file.  If the validation
error was reported during a script load then the load will be terminated but can
be retried after script editing.
