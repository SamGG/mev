	<h1>GDM: Gene Distance Matrix</h1> <h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>
The Distance Matrix is used to view distances between elements in the data set.
All clustering algorithms partition the data based on these computed distances and this
viewer can provide a direct view of these distances.

<h2>Sample Selection</h2>
The sample selection option indicates whether to display a matrix of gene distances or experiment distances.
<br>

<h2>Show Every</h2>
This allows a user to only display distances for a smaller sampling of the data by skipping
(not including) distances by the increment given.  This option is useful when one doesn't need
or want to create a full size matrix which is organized by cluster membership.
In this case the user can use the matrix with a few representatives from each cluster
to get a feel for intra-cluster distances.
