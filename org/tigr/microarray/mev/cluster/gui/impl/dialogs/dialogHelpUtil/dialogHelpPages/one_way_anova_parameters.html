            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Number of Groups </h2>
Specify the number of groups (>2) into which experiments will be placed. On hitting OK, 
an input screen for the specified umber of groups will be created. Once that is done, 
selection buttons allow the assignment of experiments to the appropriate classes. 
Groupings can be saved, loaded, and reset using the buttons below the group selection 
controls.

<h2>P-value / false discovery parameters</h2>
P-values are currently computed only from the F-distribution. Genes with a p-value less 
than the alpha or critical p-value are considered significant. When using false discovery
options, the signficant gene list contains no more than the number or proportion of specified
false significant genes, at a confidence of [1 - alpha]

<h2>Hierarchical Clustering </h2>
This check box specifies whether to perform hierarchical clustering on the elements in 
each cluster created
