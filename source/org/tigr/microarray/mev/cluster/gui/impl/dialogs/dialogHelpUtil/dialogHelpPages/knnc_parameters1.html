<H2> Classify or validate </H2>
You can classify unknowns based on a training set consisting of knowns. You can validate the training set by leaving out each 
element of the training set in turn, and using the remaining elements of the training set to classify the one left out.
You can thus assess the quality of the training classes. A good training class should have most of its original members 
classified into itself during this process (cross validation), and it should have few members of other training classes falsely assigned to it.
