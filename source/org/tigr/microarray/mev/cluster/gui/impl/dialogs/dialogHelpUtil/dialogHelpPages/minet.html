	<h1>MINET: Mutual Information Network</h1> 
	
    <hr size = 10>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For a given dataset, minet infers the network in two steps. First, the mutual information between all pairs of 
    	</br>variables in dataset is computed according to the estimator argument. 
    	</br>Then the algorithm given by method considers the estimated mutual information in order to build the network.</p>
	<p>
	<h2>Parameters</h2>
	<ol>
		<li><b>Dataset</b>: A cluster of genes.</li>
		<li><b>Method</b>: The inference algorithm: 
			<ol>
			<li><b>CLR: </b>
				The CLR algorithm is an extension of relevance network. This algorithm computes the mutual information for each pair 
				</br>of genes and derives a score related to the empirical distribution of the MI values.Instead of considering the mutual 
				</br>information I(Xi;Xj) between features Xi and Xj, it takes into account the score from the mean and the standard deviation 
				</br>of the empirical distribution of the mutual information values I(Xi;Xk), k=1,...,n.
			</li>
			<li><b>Aracne: </b>
				The Aracne procedure starts by assigning to each pair of nodes a weight equal to their mutual
				</br>information. Then, the weakest edge of each triplet is interpreted as an indirect interaction and is
				</br>removed if the difference between the two lowest weights is above a threshold eps.
			</li>
			<li><b>MRNET: </b>
				The MRNET approach consists in repeating a MRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) feature selection procedure 
				</br>for each variable of the dataset. The MRMR method starts by selecting the variable Xi having the highest mutual
				</br>information with the target Y. In the following steps, given a set S of selected variables, the criterion
				</br>updates S by choosing the variable Xk that maximizes the MRMR score. The weight of each pair Xi;Xj will be the maximum 
				</br>score between the one computed when Xi is the target and the one computed when Xj is the target.
			</li>
			<li><b>MRNETB: </b>
				MRNETB takes the mutual information matrix as input in order to infer the network using the maximum
				</br>relevance/minimum redundancy feature selection method - see MRNET. 
				</br>This method is a variant of MRNET (not yet available).
			</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li><b>Estimator</b>: The name of the entropy estimator to be used for mutual information computation: 
				</br>"mi.empirical", "mi.mm", "mi.shrink", "mi.sg", "spearman", "kendall", "pearson".
		</li> 
		<li><b>Discretization</b>: The name of the discretization method to be used, if required by the estimator 
				</br>"none", "equalfreq", "equalwidth" or "globalequalwidth".
		</li>
		<li><b>Number of Bins</b>:  Integer specifying the number of bins to be used for the discretization 
				</br>if disc is set properly. By default the number of bins is set to sqrt(N) where N is the number of samples.
		</li>
		<li><b>Output</b>: Minet returns a matrix which is the weighted adjacency matrix of the network. 
				</br>The weights range from 0 to 1 and can be seen as a confidence measure on the presence of the arcs. 
				</br>In order to display the network, MeV launches Cytoscape via webstart and displays the network in that application.
		</li>

	<h2>How to Run MINET</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Create Cluster</li>
		<li>Launch MINET from ToolBar -> Statistics -> MINET</li>
		<li>Un-select samples to be excluded from analysis (optional)</li>
		<li>Select one cluster from Cluster selection Panel.</li>
		<li>Click on Parameters tab to change method, estimator etc or leave them as is to accept default</li>
		<li>Hit OK</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	
	<p>
	<h2>Viewing the network</h2>
	The network is displayed in Cytoscape. In the initial view all nodes are stacked up on top of each other. 
	</br>In Cytoscape follow MenuBar -> Layout -> yFiles Ð> Organic (or any layout of your choice) to layout the nodes.
