	<h1>LIMMA: Linear Models for Microarray Data</h1><h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>
BETR is a flexible linear random-effects modeling framework that takes into account 
correlations between samples and sampling times.
<h2> Type of Data </h2>
Choose the type of data that BETR will run on.  
<br>
2-Condition:  Each condition must have multiple replicates for each time-point.  <br>
1-Condition:  Only one condition, the initial time-point will be treated as the control.<br>
Paired data:  Data exists as a difference between two-conditions.
<h2> Choosing Time and Conditions </h2>
After choosing the type of data and number of time-points a dialog appears for time 
and condition assignments.  You may assign your samples using either the individual button selection method
or the cluster selection method. <br>
For each condition every time-point must be assigned at least two samples.
<br>
<h2>Alpha value</h2>
This text field allows you to enter the alpha or critical p-value.
<br>
<h2>Hierarchical Clustering </h2>
This check box specifies whether to perform hierarchical clustering on the elements in 
each cluster created
