	<h1>LEM: Linear Expression Map</h1><h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

These initialization parameters are used to direct MeV to information about the
nature of the arrayed spots and the sampled genome.  The parameters that are 
selected in this dialog will determine the Linear Expression Map that is produced.
Incorrect selections will produce maps that are not correct.  If a map looks
unusual you can check the entered parameters in the <i>LEM Mapping Summary</i>
node on the result tree.

<h2>Locus Identifier Selection</h2>
This menu provides a list all spot annotation fields in MeV. 
Select the annotation field that should be used to map each spot
to an associated locus.

<h2>Coordinate Data Selections</h2>

<b><i>Use Coordinate File</i></b><br>
This option, when selected, indicates that chromosome location and
coordinate information will come from an auxilliary file.  The format of this
file is shown in the manual section for LEM.  The coordinate file is a text
tab delimited format file that contains no header and 3 or 4 columns.

<br><center> &#60 locus_id &#62 [chromosome_id] &#60 5'_end &#62 &#60 3'_end &#62 </center><br>

The second column, chromosome_id is only needed if the organisim under
study has multple chromosomes.<br><br>

<b><i>Multiple Chromosomes</i></b><br>
If selected, this option indicates that there are spots from loci on 
multiple chromosomes on the array.  When selected the information to map
loci to chromosomes is expected to be in the input file or within an
annoation field if the coordinate file is not used.  If not using a file one
should indicate which field of spot annotation corresponds to chromosomal
membership information. (mapping spots to chromosomes)<br><br>

<b><i>Coordinate Information</i></b><br>
If not using a coordinate file, these menus are used to
select annotation fields that indicate 5' and 3' ends of the locus.<br>
