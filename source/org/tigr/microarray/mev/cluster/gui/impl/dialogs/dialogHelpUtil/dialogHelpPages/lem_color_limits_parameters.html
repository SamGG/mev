	<h1>LEM: Bin Boundary Limits and Colors</h1><h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>
            
This dialog controls the limits and assigned colors that are referenced
when using the color bin expression rendering option to render locus expression<br><br>
<b>Note:</b>When using the 3 bin mode only the end colors (outer most)
and end bin limits are used to define the bins.<br><br>
The entered value limits should be distinct and increase in value from
left to right.  This convention is enforced so that if one switches
from 3 bins to 5 bins the bin limits are valid.<br><br>
To change a bin's color, simply click on the bin and a dialog with
a palette will be displayed.  You can drag the circle in the palette
to change the tone of the displayed color.  The slider to the right
can select different gradient palletes.  The color chooser also has
a pane that permits selection of specific color swatches.
