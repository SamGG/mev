	<h1>Experiment Sorter / Experiment Label Editor</h1><h2>Editor Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Overview </h2>
The primary function of the Editor is to permit the modification of labels (attributes) associated with
the loaded experiments.  Note that the first row in the table contains the default
experiment name and that label can not be edited nor can it be deleted.  The second major function
is to enable the order of loaded experiments to be rearranged.  Two menus are available 
within the editor frame for performing editor actions.  The two menus contain the same menu options.
One is in the main menu bar and the other is available using a right mouse click with the mouse cursor
over a table cell.

<h2>Experiment Reordering</h2>
The order of the columns in the table can be altered by clicking on the column header and dragging the
column to the desired location.  This action alone does not force the loaded data to be reordered.
The table order can be imposed on the loaded data if the check box menu item is selected to
<i>Enable Experiment Reordering</i>.  This ordering is imposed as soon as the dialog is dismissed.
<br><br>
<b>Note:  If analyses have been run on the loaded data, the reordering option is disabled. This is done
as a precaution against misrepresentation of prior results that may have relied on the original ordering.
Typically the reordering of experiments should be done just after data loading to place associated
experiments into an order that is reasonable based on study design.</b>

<h2>Experiment Label Editing</h2>
<h3>Adding Experiment Labels</h3>
The <i>Add New Experiment Label</i> menu item is used to create a new row in the table.  Note that the
first cell in the new row is light yellow and is used to indicate a <i>Label Key</i>.  This
key will be placed into the 'Experiment Label' menu in the 'Display' menu so that when selected
this label type will be displayed for the loaded experiments.  Once a Label Key is entered a double
click on the remaining cells will allow editing to add appropriate labels for each experiment.
Reopening the editor will allow you to alter any label or label key visible in the table except for
the default primary label and key (shown in gray). Any experiments for which labels would not apply
can be left blank and will appear this way in displays where experiment labels are present.

<h3>Merging Experiment Labels</h3>
Occasionally is is convenient to merge several attributes or labels to produce a more informative
label for each experiment.  To merge labels start by selecting two or more rows using control click
and then selecting the <i>Merge Selected Rows</i> menu item.  A small list will be presented
that can be used to order the selected labels before actual merging.  Once this is accomplished
a new row is inserted in the table to display the merged labels and the merged label key.
