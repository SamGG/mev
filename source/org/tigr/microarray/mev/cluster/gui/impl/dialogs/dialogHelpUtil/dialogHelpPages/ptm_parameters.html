	<h1>PTM: Pavlidis Template Matching</h1><h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2>Template Selection Tabs</h2>
The five tabbed panels at the top of the dialog select to view candidate templates
from various sources.
<br><br>
The Gene Template tab provides a list of genes in the data set and their expression
profile graphs. Selection of elements in the list display the expression pattern for
that gene.
<br><br>
The Gene Cluster Template tab provides a list and view of templates which are the
mean values of stored (colored) clusters.
<br><br>
The Experiment Template, and Experiment Cluster Template tabs provide the same
functionality but use experiment templates.
<br><br>
The Saved Template tab provides an interface for loading gene and
experiment templates.  Templates loaded from files will populate a list from
which a template may be selected.
<br><br>
A button in each of these areas is used to select the displayed template for
matching.
<br>

<h2>Threshold Parameters</h2>
<h3>Use Absolute R</h3>
Using this option will select expression patterns that are either positively
or negatively correlated with the template.
<h3>Use Threshold R</h3>
This option will indicate that the threshold value for determining a match is
the R value between the expression vector and the template.
<h3>Use Threshold p-Value</h3>
This option will indicate that the threshold value for determining a match is
the p value on R between the expression vector and the template.
<h3>Threshold Input Value</h3>
This is either a supplied value for R or a p-value ranging from 0.0 to 1.0.
R values closer to 1.0 are more stringent.  p-values closer to 0 are more stringent.
<br>
<h2>Save Template</h2>
This button launches a file browser to allow the user to save the current template
to a tab delimited text file.  These files can be loaded from the Saved Template tab
interface.
<br>
<h2> Hierarchical Clustering </h2>
This check box selects whether to perform hierarchical clustering on the elements in the
resulting matched and unmatched element sets.
