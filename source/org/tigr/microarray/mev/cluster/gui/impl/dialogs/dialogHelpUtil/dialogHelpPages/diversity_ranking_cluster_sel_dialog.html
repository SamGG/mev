	<h1>Diversity Ranking Cluster Selection</h1>
            <hr size = 10>

Diversity Ranking cluster selection is an algorithm used to rank a set of clusters
based on diversity and then select candidate clusters meeting supplied criteria.
This process will tend to find clusters that meet a minimum size and have relatively
lower variability between the expression vectors contained in the cluster.  This process 
will find the least variable clusters but there is no means to know if the clusters 
found will have interesting expression changes over the set of observations.

Note: See Centroid Variability or Entropy Ranking cluster selection for methods that try
to select clusters that have maximal centroid variance over the observations.  In some cases
it might be advisable to try several selection methods on an input set of clusters.

<h1>Parameters</h1>
<h2>Desired Number of Clusters</h2>
This parameter indicates the number of clusters that should be selected from the input set.  
If during execution it turns out that the number of input clusters is smaller than the 
number of clusters desired, then all input clusters are returned as the result.

<h2>Minimum Cluster Population (# of elements)</h2>
The minimum cluster size describes the minimum number of genes or experiments that should
be in the cluster.  In some cases clusters may have low variability but are only composed of
a couple of elements.

<h2>Rank Clusters on Centroid Based Diversity</h2>
Centroid based diversity is the mean distance between a each element in the cluster and the 
cluster's centroid (mean expression pattern for the cluster).   (Distance metric is determined
by the current global metric defined in the 'Distance' menu. Euclidean is the default metric.)

<h2>Rank Clusters on Intra-gene Based Diversity</h2>
Intra-gene based diversity is the mean distance between each element in the cluster to
every other gene in the cluster.  (Distance metric is determined
by the current global metric defined in the 'Distance' menu. Euclidean is the default metric.)
