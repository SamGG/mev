            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Sample Selection </h2>
The sample selection option indicates whether to cluster genes or experiments.
<br>

<h2> Distance Metric Selection </h2>
This area allows the selection of the metric to be used to assess gene-to-gene
or sample-to-sample distances.  The initial metric displayed (choosen) corresponds to the global
setting in the Multiple Array Viewer's 'Metrics' menu.  Alterations to the
chosen metric in this dialog will only alter the metric used for the current
algorithm run.  The global setting in the main 'Metrics' menu will remain unchanged.
<br><br>
An appendix in the MeV manual describes the distance metrics offered in MeV. 
<br>

<h2>Maximum Cluster Diameter</h2>
Cluster Diameter is related to the overall variability between the member elements
within a cluster.  Maximum Cluster Diameter is a constraint on that variance such that all
formed clusters must have a diameter (variability) smaller that the entered maximum.
Increasing the maximum diameter tends to make larger and more variable clusters and
decreasing the maximum diameter tends to produce smaller less variable clusters.
<br>

<h2>Minimum Cluster Population</h2>
The minimum number of elements required to be present in order to 
form a cluster.  For instance a Minimum Cluster Population of 10
insures that all formed clusters will have at least 10 members.
<br>

<h2> Hierarchical Clustering </h2>
This check box selects whether to perform hierarchical clustering on the elements in each cluster
created.
