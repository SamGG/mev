	<h1>Script Algorithm Selection</h1>
            <hr size = 10>

This dialog is used to select algorithms during script construction.
During selection the text fields in the Selection Preview panel will
change to indicate the current selection. <br><br>

There are three basic classes of algorithms from which to choose.


<h2>Analysis Algorithms</h2>
These algorithms include gene and experiment clustering algorithms, 
classification algorithms, statistical algorithms, and data visualizations.
<br>

<h2>Adjustment Algorithms</h2>
The Adjustment algorithms are those algorithms found in the Adjustment
menu of the Multiple Array Viewer interface and include the Affymetrix™
based filters if Affymetrix ™ data is currently loaded.  The Adjustment 
algorithms either filter the data based on some criteria or are used to 
perform a mathematical transformation of the data.  These filtering or
transformation options are typically run before cluster analysis.
<br>

<h2>Cluster Selection Algorithms</h2>
The cluster selection algorithms are specific to scripting in MeV.  
Automatic Cluster Selection allows the user to provide criteria for 
evaluating cluster results where clusters have no intrinsic identity 
such as “significant genes”.  Once the set of input clusters are
characterized, the clusters can be ranked based on criteria such
as cluster diversity or centroid variance.
