<h2> Gradient Style </h2>
The gradient style controls are used to select to use either
a double gradient such as green-black-red or a single gradient
such as black-red.  The double gradient is most often used for
two dye array systems in which the values are log<sub>2</sub>
ratios. In this case the mid-point is kept at 0.0 so that
spots where the two channels have equal expression (log<sub>2</sub>(A/B) = 0) are
depicted as black and spots where the expression is unequal will
tend to be colored more toward the extremes.  The double gradient
might also be useful for single dye systems where a reference
or median value is used to generate a log<sub>2</sub>(I/Ref).
<br><br>
The single gradient option is useful for single channel data
where data falls over a continuum and there is no clear rationale
to separate the data into two distinct color regions.

<h2> Color Range Selection </h2>
This section of the dialog is used to indicate the limits for the
color scale and an optional "mid-point" value.  The single gradient mode
only requires endpoints while the double gradient mode provides
for selection of a mid-point value.  For two dye systems the mid-point
should generally be left at zero so that spots with equal expression
in the two channels are displayed as black.  
<br><br>
Values that exceed the limits that are set will be displayed as the
saturated endpoint color.  The range of the data is given in parentheses
next to the limit input boxes to assist in initial limit selections.
The <i>Update Limits</i> button in this panel will apply the current
limits to the display in MeV and will update the 
<i>Color Saturation Statistics</i> panel and <i>Gradient and Limits Preview</i> panel.

<h2> Color Saturation Statistics </h2>
This section of the dialog reports the number of elements that are 
beyond the limits defined by the color scale.  These off-scale 
elements are displayed as the endpoint color of gradient closest
to the element's value.  The statistics are calculted using all 
spots that are not missing values and have not been filtered out of
the main data set by an applied filter.

<h2> Limits and Gradient Preview </h2>
This panel presents the current gradient style and the selected range limits.
