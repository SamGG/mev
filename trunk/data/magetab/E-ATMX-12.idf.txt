Protocol Description	Each well of 96-well microtiter plates received 10 surface-sterilized seeds in 150 µl of liquid medium [0.5 x Murashige and Skoog salts, 1.3 mM 2-(4-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (MES)-KOH, pH 5.7]. After stratification (4 d at 4°C), the plates were transferred to an orbital shaker with a 16-h light cycle at 22°C. After 5 days of growth, the medium was replaced with appropriate treatment media.	Treated with 2.8% (v/v) dimethylsulfoxyde (solvent). A control for HSP90 inhibitors treatment.	For geldanamycin (GDA, HSP90 inhibitor) treatment, the seedlings were incubated in medium containing 50 µM GDA (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Stock solutions of GDA (1 mg/ml) was prepared by dissolving the drugs in dimethylsulfoxyde.	For heat shock treatment, the seedlings were incubated at 37°C for 2 h. 	For radicicol (RAD, HSP90 inhibitor) treatment, the seedlings were incubated in medium containing 50 µM RAD (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Stock solutions of RAD (1 mg/ml) was prepared by dissolving the drugs in dimethylsulfoxyde.	No treatment. A control for heat shock treatment.	Total RNA was extracted from 40 seedlings.	Total RNA extracted by using Isogen (Nippon Gene, Toyama, Japan) was dissolved in 25 µl of distilled water. 	Cy-5 labeled cRNA was synthesized using Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent, product # 5184-3523) from total RNA and fragmented according to the manufacturer`s instructions.	Hybridization using In situ Hybridization Kit Plus (Agilent, product #5184-3568) according to the manufacturer's instructions (protocol: Part #G4140-96010)	PMT 100%	Per chip: normalize to 50th percentile. GeneSpring ver 7.2 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used for processing.
