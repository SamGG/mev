352837	Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2, catalytic domain homologues
352864	ARF-like small GTPases
352897	RNA recognition motif
353118	Serine/Threonine protein kinases, catalytic domain
353118	Domain present in PSD-95, Dlg, and ZO-1/2. Also called DHR (Dlg homologous region) or GLGF (relatively well conserved tetrapeptide in these domains). Some PDZs have been shown to bind C-terminal polypeptides
353130	Trypsin-like serine protease
353149	Domain in Tre-2, BUB2p, and Cdc16p. Probable Rab-GAPs. Widespread domain present in Gyp6 and Gyp7, thereby giving rise to the notion that it performs a GTP-activator activity on Rab-like GTPases
353188	ADAM Cysteine-Rich Domain
353188	Homologues of snake disintegrins
353211	Domain in homologues of a S. cerevisiae phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (Sec14p)
353233	domain in glucosyltransferases, myotubularins and other putative membrane-associated proteins
353251	Trypsin-like serine protease
353253	Immunoglobulin
353274	leucine rich region
353274	krueppel associated box
353283	Ras subfamily of RAS small GTPases
353287	C-type lectin (CTL) or carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD)
353287	SCP / Tpx-1 / Ag5 / PR-1 / Sc7 family of extracellular domains. Human glioma pathogenesis-related protein GliPR and the plant pathogenesis-related protein represent functional links between plant defense systems and human immune system. This family has n
353302	Kinesin motor, catalytic domain. ATPase. Microtubule-dependent molecular motors that play important roles in intracellular transport of organelles and in cell division
353305	Domain first found in the mice T locus (Brachyury) protein
353328	von Willebrand factor (vWF) type D domain
353328	C-terminal cystine knot-like domain (CTCK)
353355	krueppel associated box
353376	Toll - interleukin 1 - resistance
353500	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family
359710	BPI/LBP/CETP C-terminal domain

359959	Ras subfamily of RAS small GTPases
360013	Myosin. Large ATPases. ATPase
360013	Domain present in PSD-95, Dlg, and ZO-1/2. Also called DHR (Dlg homologous region) or GLGF (relatively well conserved tetrapeptide in these domains). Some PDZs have been shown to bind C-terminal polypeptides
360161	Serine/Threonine protein kinases, catalytic domain
360204	leucine rich region
