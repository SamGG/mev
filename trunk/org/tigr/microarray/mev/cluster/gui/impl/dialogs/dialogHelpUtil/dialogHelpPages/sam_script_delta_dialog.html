	<h1>SAM: Delta Selection</h1> <h2>Script Creation</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Delta Value </h2>
Typical SAM runs provide an interactive graph and delta slider
for selection of a delta value and associated false discovery rate.
During SAM parameter selection for script creation this dialog permits
the user to enter a delta value directly.  This eliminates the interactive
graph which can be desirable during long script executions.
<br><br>
Alternatively, one can select the check box to enable the SAM graph
interaction.  If this is selected the script will execute up until
the graph is displayed.  Once the graph is used for delta selection
and dismissed, the algorithm and subsequent algorithms in the script will
be executed.
