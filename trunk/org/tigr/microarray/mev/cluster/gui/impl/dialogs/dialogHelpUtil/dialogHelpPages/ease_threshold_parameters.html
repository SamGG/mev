	<h1>EASE Hierarchy Thresholds</h1>
            <hr size = 10>

The GO term hierarchy viewer presents a color representing the p-value of
each node based on EASE cluster analysis EASE Score or Fisher's Exact Test.  
Note that in verbose rendering mode the actual p-value is displayed.  For quick
assessment, two thresholds are set to bin the p-values of the nodes in the hierarchy.
The current thresholds are displayed in the key in the header of the viewer.
<br><br>
The Lower Threshold ranges from 0 to 1 and should be smaller than the Upper Threshold,
thus indicating a higher or more stringent level of significance.  The Upper Threshold is
set similarly but is constrained to be higher that the lower threshold.
