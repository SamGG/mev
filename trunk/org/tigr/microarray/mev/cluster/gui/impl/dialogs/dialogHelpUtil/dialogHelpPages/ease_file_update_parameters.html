	<h1>EASE Annotation File Updates</h1> <h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>
This EASE File Update dialog presents selections that help specify species and array type when
updating or downloading the EASE annotation file system.
Online resources for the selected species and array will be downloaded following a prompt for
a destination folder.  Two zip files will be downloaded and automatically extracted to build the
EASE file system to support the array that you selected.  Note that while MeV can download
and extract the zip files, MeV can not automatically delete the zip files after extraction
due to permissions constraints.  You may delete the zip files or move them after they
have been extracted.
<br><br>
During the zip downloads and extractions (un-zipping) the progress will be reported by
a progress bar.  A final confirmation message will be displayed to indicate a successful
file download and file system build.
