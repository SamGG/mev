	<h1>HCL: Hierarchical Clustering</h1><h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Linkage Method </h2>
This parameter is used to indicate the convention
used for determining cluster-to-cluster distances
when constructing the hierarchical tree.
<br><br>
Single Linkage: The distances are measured between
each member of one cluster each member of the other
cluster.  The minimum of these distances is considered
the cluster-to-cluster distance.
<br><br>
Average Linkage: The average distance of each member of
one cluster to each member of the other cluster is used
as a measure of cluster-to-cluster distance.
<br><br>
Complete Linkage: The distances are measured between
each member of one cluster each member of the other
cluster.  The maximum of these distances is considered
the cluster-to-cluster distance.
<br>
<h2>Cluster Genes / Cluster Experiments Options</h2>
These checkboxes are used to indicate whether to cluster
genes, experiments, or both.
