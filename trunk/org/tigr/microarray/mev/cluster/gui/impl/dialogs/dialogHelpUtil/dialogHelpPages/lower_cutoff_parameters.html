<h2>Overview of Lower Cutoffs</h2>
The lower cutoff data adjustment is used to trim out genes having low intensity
data.  The trim criteria is such that if any one expression value for a gene falls
below the Cy3 or Cy5 intensity value cutoffs then that gene will excluded from
further analysis.  This method is rather stringent since the entire gene is removed
from analysis if it fails for one intensity in one experiment.
<br><br>
One possible utility is to exclude genes with missing data by setting the
cutoffs to a very low value such as 1.  The possibility of exclusion increases
with increased number of experiments making this feature impractical for many
data sets.<br><br>
Note that if the goal is to make sure that a gene has valid data representing
most of the experiments, percentage cutoffs is a more flexible alternative.
