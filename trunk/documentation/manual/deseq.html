			<h1>DESeq: Digital gene expresion analysis based on the negative binomial distribution</h1> 
			
			<hr size = 10>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					The BioC package DESeq provides a powerful tool to estimate the variance in count data and 
					test for differential expression. It can estimate variance-mean dependence in count data 
					from high-throughput sequencing assays and test for differential expression based 
					on a model using the negative binomial distribution.
					<b>Variance estimation</b>
					The core assumption of this method is that the mean is a good predictor of the variance, i.e., 
					that genes with a similar expression level also have similar variance across replicates. 
					Hence, we need to estimate for each condition a function that allows to predict the variance 
					from the mean. This estimation is done by calculating, for each gene, the sample mean and 
					variance within replicates and then tting a curve to this data.

					<h2>Parameters</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Dataset</b>: 2 sample groups.</li>
						<li><b>P-value/Fdr</b>Significance Cutt-off method and value.</li>
						<li><b>Output</b>: DESeq creates a standard MeV viewer nodeo nthe left tree which conists of heatmaps and tables of
							both significant, non-significant and a combined list of genes.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

					<h2>How to Run DESeq</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Load DESeq type data</li>
						<li>Launch DESeq from ToolBar -> Statistics -> DESeq</li>
						<li>Assign samples to 2 groups or leave them out</li>
						<li>Choose significance coutt-off method (p-value or fdr) and specify a value</li>
						<li>Hit OK</li>
					</ol>
