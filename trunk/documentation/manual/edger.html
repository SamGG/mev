			<h1>edgeR: a Bioconductor package for differential expression analysis of digital gene expression data</h1> 
			
			<hr size = 10>
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining
					differential expression of replicated count data. An over-dispersed
					Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical
					variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree
					of over-dispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of
					inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal
					levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental
					condition is replicated.
				</p>
				<p>
					<h2>Parameters</h2>
					<ol>
						<li><b>Dataset</b>: 2 sample groups.</li>
						<li><b>Method</b>: The inference algorithm: 
							<ol>
								<li><b>Common Dispersion: </b>
									Common dispersion for <b>all</b> the tags is estimated using the quantile-adjusted 
									conditional maximum likelihood (qCML) method.
								</li>
								<li><b>Moderated Tagwise Dispersion: </b>
									Separate estimate of dispersions for <b>individual</b> tags using qCML. As individual tags 
									typically don't provide enough data to estimate the dispersion reliably, edgeR 
									implements an empirical Bayes strategy for squeezing the tagwise dispersions
									towards the common dispersion. The amount of shrinkage is determined by the 
									prior weight given to the common dispersion and the precision of the tagwise 
									estimates.
								</li>
							</ol>
						</li>
						<li><b>Output</b>: edgeR creates a standard MeV viewer nodeo nthe left tree which conists of heatmaps and tables of
							both significant, non-significant and a combined list of genes.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</p>
				
				<p>
					<h2>How to Run edgeR</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>Load RNAseq type data</li>
						<li>Launch edgeR from ToolBar -> Statistics -> edgeR</li>
						<li>Assign samples to 2 groups or leave them out</li>
						<li>Choose inferecne method</li>
						<li>Choose significance coutt-off method (p-value or fdr) and specify a value</li>
						<li>Hit OK</li>
					</ol>
