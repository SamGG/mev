	<h1>SOM: Self Organizing Maps</h1><h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2>Basic Terminology</h2>
Node: an SOM structure to which expression elements are associated to form clusters.
<br><br>
SOM Vector: a vector of size n, associated with a node that represents the nodes location
in the n dimensional space.  Each node has one SOM Vector.
<br><br>
Training/Adaptation:  the process of repositioning the SOM Nodes by altering their associated
SOM Vectors.  The adaptation process is a result of an expression element being associated
with a node.  The new position is determined by the distance between the expression element
and the SOM Vector, the Alpha value, and the neighborhood convention (see below).
<br><br>
Topology: a two dimensional topology used to define how node-to-node distances are calculated.
<br><br>
Note that a cluster is a collection of expression elements associated with a Node.
<br>
           
<h2>Sample Selection</h2>
The sample selection option indicates whether to cluster genes or experiments.
<br>

<h2> Distance Metric Selection </h2>
This area allows the selection of the metric to be used to assess gene-to-gene
or sample-to-sample distances.  The initial metric displayed (choosen) corresponds to the global
setting in the Multiple Array Viewer's 'Metrics' menu.  Alterations to the
chosen metric in this dialog will only alter the metric used for the current
algorithm run.  The global setting in the main 'Metrics' menu will remain unchanged.
<br><br>
An appendix in the MeV manual describes the distance metrics offered in MeV. 
<br>

<h2>Dimension X</h2>
This positive integer value determines the X dimension of the resulting topology.
<br>

<h2>Dimension Y</h2>
This positive integer value determines the Y dimension of the resulting topology.
Note that Dimension X times Dimension Y gives the number of clusters that will
be produced.
<br>

<h2>Iterations</h2>
This positive integer value indicates the total number of times that the data set
will be presented to the network (or Map, Graph).  Each expression element
will be presented this number of times to train the Nodes.
<br>

<h2>Alpha</h2>
This value is used to scale the alteration of SOM vectors when a new expression
vector is associated with a node.
<br>


<h2>Radius</h2>
When using the bubble neighborhood parameter this float value is used to
define the extent of the neighborhood.  If an SOM vector is within this
distance from the winning node (the cluster to which an element has
been assigned) then that Node (and SOM vector) is considered to be in the neighborhood
and it's SOM vector is adapted.
<br>

<h2>Initialization</h2>
Random Genes or Random Experiments: Indicates that the initial SOM vectors will be selected
at random as actual elements in the data.
<br><br>
Random Vector: Indicates that the initial SOM vectors will be constructed as random vectors
generated to reflect the magnitude of the data set.  These initial vectors are not actual
expression vectors in the data set.
<br>

<h2>Neighborhood</h2>
The neighborhood options indicate the conventions (formulas) used to update (adapt) an SOM vector
once an expression vector has been added into a Node's neighborhood.
<br><br>
Bubble: This option uses the provided radius (see above) to determine which surrounding
SOM nodes are in the neighborhood and therefore are candidates for adaptation.
When this option is selected the Alpha parameter for scaling the adaptation is used directly
as provided from the user.
<br><br>
Gaussian: This option forces all SOM vectors in the network to be adapted regardless of proximity to the
winning node.  In this case the Alpha parameter is scaled based on the distance between
the SOM vector to be adapted and the winning node's SOM vector.
<br>

<h2>Topology</h2>
Indicates whether the topology should be rectangular or hexagonal.  If rectangular topology is selected
the node-to-node distance is determined as Euclidean distance within the two dimensional
x-y grid.  If hexagonal distance is used an appropriate formula is used to determine the distance
given the coordinates of the two nodes.
<br>

<h2> Hierarchical Clustering </h2>
This check box selects whether to perform hierarchical clustering on the elements in each cluster
created.
