	<h1>Cluster Archive Initialization</h1> <h2> Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Analysis Node </h2>
This non-editable field displays the algorithm node including the result index
from the result navigation tree.  This is unique for an algorithm execution.
<br>

<h2> Cluster Node </h2>
This non-editable field identifies the result cluster node from the navigation
tree which contains the members of the cluster.  Note that it is a child node under
the Analysis Node.  Note that different viewers identifying the same cluster
will have the same Cluster Node label.  Since they represent the same elements
the user is given the option of modifying the cluster attributes when attempting
to save a cluster for a second time.
<br>

<h2> Cluster Label  </h2>
Cluster Label is an optional field that can be used to designate a descriptive label
for the stored cluster.
<br>

<h2> Remarks </h2>
The Remarks text area provides a means to give a more descriptive account of the nature of
the cluster or the algorithm and parameters used to generate the cluster.
<br>

<h2> Select Color and Color Preview </h2>
The Select Color button presents a user interface to select a color for the cluster.
All cluster member elements will be assigned this color.  This color will propagate to
all cluster viewers and is the main means of qualitatively determining clustering
consensus between algorithm methods or parameter selections.
<br><br>
The Reset button will return the dialog to it's initial state.  If the form was presented
for modifying the attributes of an existing cluster these values are those of the initial
cluster.  The Cancel button terminates the cluster storage or modification.
