	<h1>SOTA Tree Configuration</h1> <h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Distance Threshold </h2>
This floating point parameter is used as a cutoff value.  Elements on nodes
which have distances below this threshold can be considered as one entity
(or cluster). Consequently the lower level detail of the tree is ignored.
<br>
<h2> Minimum Pixel Distance </h2>
This integer is the minimum height of a node in the tree in units of pixels.
Nodes which are close and would ordinarily have a node height below
this value are forced to appear this number of pixels above the
lower level node.
<br>
<h2> Maximum Pixel Distance </h2>
Maximum Pixel Distance (integer) is the maximum distance that any node can have.
Nodes which are distant and would ordinarily have a node height greater
than this value are constrained to appear this number of pixels above the
lower level node.
