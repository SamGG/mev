<h2> Search Mode Selection </h2>
The search mode options permit searching for genes or samples.

<h2>Search Term and Match Criteria</h2>
The <i>Search Term</i> text field permits the input of the term to search for within the
gene or sample annotation.  The <i>Case Sensitive</i> option insures that all matches contain the search term
including matching the case of each letter. The <i>Exact Match</i> option insures that
all matching annotation contains the search term and no extra characters.  If this option
is in the default (off) mode then the annotation matches only need to contain the search term within
the annotation. (e.g. If the search term is <i>proton</i> then valid matches could be <i>proton transport</i>, 
<i>proton pump</i>, or any other annotation term containing <i>proton</i>.
<br>

<h2>Searchable Fields</h2>
This lists the annotation fields that can be searched and permits the selection of specific fields.
Note that the fields are gene or sample specific and are tailored to the loaded annotation.
Selection of specific fields will permit the you to target the search.  The <i>Select All Fields</i>
and the <i>Reset Selection</i> are used to assist in annotation field selection.
