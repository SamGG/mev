            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Sample Selection (genes/experiments)</h2>
The sample selection option indicates whether to perform the analysis
on genes or experiments.
<br>
<h2> Neighbors </h2>
Each element is first mapped to an x-y coordinate on the map based on 
it's similarity to a group of its most closely related neighbors.  The mapping
to the x-y coordinate system is based on degree of similarity.  (The method is
described in some detail in the reference for TRN.) The entered number determines
the number of nearest neighbors that will influence an element's position
in the x-y grid.
<br><br>
The z dimension represents the density of elements within a given area.
