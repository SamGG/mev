<h3>Mage Tab File Format</h3>
The MAGE-TAB specification can be found at: http://ebi.ac.uk/ArrayExpress .
This format includes files that describe an experimental series, the samples used in the experimental series,<br/>
optionally the array design of the microarray chips employed in the study, and a data matrix file containing gene expression data values<br/>
TDMS files encapsulate the expression data from multiple samples into a single tab delimited file.<br/>
Each sample represented in the file will have a single dedicated column that contains the expression data for that sample.<br/>
Each row, below the header rows, represents information relating to a particular spot on the slide.<br/>
