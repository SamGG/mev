	<h1>PCA: Principal Components</h1> <h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2> Sample Selection </h2>
The sample selection option indicates whether to perform the analysis
on genes or experiments.
<br>

<h2> Centering Mode </h2>
The centering mode selection option determines the type of matrix 
centering (by mean, median, or none) to be performed before the PCA analysis is run
<br>

<h2> Algorithm Optimization </h2>
This option determines which algorithm to run when clustering by samples.  
The complete algorithm creates an nxn distance matrix where n is the number of genes.
As data sets get large, memory requirements increase exponentially.  For most cases, it 
is a sufficient approximation to calculate the result using the smaller mxm distance 
matrix where m is the number of samples.  This dramatically decreases memory requirements 
and calculation time.
