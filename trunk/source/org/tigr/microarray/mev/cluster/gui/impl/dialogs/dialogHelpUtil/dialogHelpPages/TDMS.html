<h3>Tab Delimited, Multiple Sample (TDMS) Format</h3>
TDMS files encapsulate the expression data from multiple samples into a single tab delimited file.  
Each sample represented in the file will have a single dedicated column that contains the expression data for that sample.  
Each row, below the header rows, represents information relating to a particular spot on the slide.
<br>
TDMS is very popular data format.It can be either affymetrix data or cDNA data. TDMS contains one or more header rows.Every column is seperated by a tab. Every row contains the express value for one gene at a different experiment.
<br>
A sample data file is displayed as following.<br>
<table border=2 >
<font size=3><tr><th><b>GeneID</th><th><b>SomeAnnotation</th><th><b>Sample1</th><th><b>Sample2</th></tr></font>        
<tr valign=top><td>gene1</td>
<td>annotation</td>
<td>0.22</td>
<td>0.42</td></tr>
