The Survival (SURV) module contains two functions for the analysis of censored survival data. The first is a basic comparison of the survival curves of two groups of samples. Sample data loaded into MeV is compared using the R package survival and the degree to which the curves differ is reported, along with a p-value.
<br>
The second feature of the module is the creation of a cox proportional hazards model based on the loaded gene expression data, using survival time as the reporting value. The R packaged penalized is used to build the model and to select the most informative genes. The L1-norm of the expression vector is used as a shrinkage parameter; users can select the lambda value. The module performs cross-validation of the model after it is built and reports a log likelihood as an indicator of model utility. 

<h3>Running Survival:</h3>
Censored survival data<br>
No matter which of these options you choose, you will need to select the sample annotation types that hold the survival data. There are two fields: survival time should point to a set of sample annotation that contains a floating-point number representing a time to event. The Censored field should point to a sample annotation field containing flags that indicate whether a given datapoint is censored or not. MeV can recognize several censoring flag types, including "Yes" or "No", "Censored/Uncensored", or 1/0.
Values of "Yes", "Censored" or "1" indicate that the datapoint should be treated as a censored event, whereas "No", "Uncensored" and "0" are treated as valid, observed events.  
<br><br>
After opening the SURV initialization dialog, select the type of analysis you want to run.  Your options are:<br>
1.)  Kaplan-Meier Plot: Choose this option if you have already selected groups of samples that are of interest to you. This option will compare the survival time of the two groups and calculate a p-value indicating whether the difference is significant. <br>
2.)  Cox Proportional Hazard Model: Choose this option if you are interested in identifying genes that appear to have predictive value relative to survival time.<br>

<br>
After choosing the analysis type, click the Continue button to generate a cluster selection panel. This panel is different depending on which analysis type you have chosen.
<br><br>
For the Kaplan-Meier plot:<br>
A sample cluster selection panel will be generated. Select which samples belong in which groups and click ok to compare the survival profiles.
Cluster Selection:<br>
Use the cluster selection panel if you have previously made clusters and wish to run your analysis based on those clusters.  
Use the drop-down boxes to choose which clusters’ samples are to be assigned to which time-points.  For clusters you are not 
using, leave “unassigned”.  The same condition and time-point requirements exist for this method, but the cluster selector makes 
for easier and more organized sample assignment.
<br><br>
For the Cox Proportional Hazard Model:<br>
A gene cluster selection panel with be generated. You can choose to select a group of genes to build the model with (faster) or choose to build the model based on all of the genes in the currently-loaded dataset (slow).
<br>
The Cox model will be build using an L1 Norm (lasso) penalty. Select the value of lambda to be used for this penalty. Higher values will result in faster-calculated models with fewer coefficients. 
<br><br>
The SURV module outputs standard viewers and tables for MeV’s statistics analyses. It also creates survival curves for the selected sample groups.<br>
