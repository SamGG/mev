            <hr size = 10>

<p>The selected expression data is being transferred at this time. 
<br><br> 
Once the data download is complete, this dialog will be dismissed and you will have 
either the data displayed in the Multiple Array Viewer or you will be given the option 
to select a subset, possibly all, of the data set to display.  This will depend on
whether the download was one file or a large collection of files.
<br><br>
After the Multiple Array Viewer launches an informative dialog will provide some
hints to enhance viewing.
