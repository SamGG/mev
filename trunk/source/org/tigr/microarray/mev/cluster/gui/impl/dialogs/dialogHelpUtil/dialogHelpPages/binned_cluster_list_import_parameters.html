            <hr size = 10>

<p> The Import Dialog is used to import gene or experiment identifiers for the
purpose of imposing or creating clusters within the loaded data set.  This enables the
user to mark genes or experiments of interest for tracking during analysis.</p>

<h2>Import Parameters</h2>
Using the combobox, select the annotation type that contains the numerical values that you wish to 
cluster.  
<br>
Fill in values for the upper and lower limits that are to contain the desired cluster.
<br>
The upper and lower limits that you have input will be used to create a cluster.  All samples (or genes) 
with a numerical value for the selected annotation type within the specified limits will be placed in a 
single cluster.
