	<h1>RP: Rank Products</h1><h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>
Rank products is a simple, yet powerful, new method to detect differentially regulated genes in replicated microarray experiments.
<h2>Group Assignments</h2>
<h3>Group Selection Controls</h3>
This set of buttons determines which experiments on which to run the analysis.
  If an experiment is unchecked it will be ignored for the purposes the analysis.
<br><br>
Note that groups A and B must each have at least two members
following the assignment.
<h3>Save Grouping</h3>
The save grouping button allows you to save the grouping
to file.  This is particularly useful when there are many experiments.
<h3>Load Grouping</h3>
This button allows you to select and load a saved grouping.
<h3>Reset</h3>
The reset button returns all of the group selection control buttons
to Group A, the initial state.
<br>
<h2>Significance Level Parameters</h2>
Significance levels are determined by random permutations.  
<br>Choose a value for the number of random permutations, 100 is the default.
<br>Choose a value (between 0 and 1) for the alpha value or critical p-value.

If permutations are used, two buttons allow you to select to permute
the values a number of times indicated or to permute the values a number of
times equal to the maximum number of permutations possible.

<H3>False discovery control</H3>
Under this option, with confidence of (1 - alpha), the number or proportion of false positives 
in the significant gene list should not exceed the input value. 
<br>
<h2> Hierarchical Clustering </h2>
This check box selects whether to perform hierarchical clustering on the elements in each cluster
created.
