	<h1>Script Value Editor</h1>
            <hr size = 10>
The Script Value Editor is used to make controlled changes to the 
script parameters.  If a line in the XMLViewer contains a
key:value pair then the <i>Edit</i> menu option is enabled.
The entered value is validated for type and that it falls within
possible magnitude constraints.  If an error has occurred then
the update will be halted and a warning will be issued.
<br><br>
The <i>View Valid Parameters</i> button will provide a table of
parameters names, their types, possible constraints,
and if the parameter is strictly required in all cases.
<br><br>
<b>Great care should be taken to insure that changes to script parameters
will not affect other algorithm parameters or the nature of the output
such that down-stream algorithms are still appropriate.</b>
