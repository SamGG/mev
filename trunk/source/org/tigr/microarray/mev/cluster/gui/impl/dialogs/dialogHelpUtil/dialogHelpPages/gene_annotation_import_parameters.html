	<h1>Gene Annotation Import Parameters</h1>
            <hr size = 10>

<p> The <i>Append Gene Annotation</i> feature is used to append additional gene annotation
from an MeV style annotation (.ann, or .dat) file.  The annotation file format is described
in detail in the File Format Appendix of the MeV manual.  This dialog presents selection lists
for two keys used to map annotation to genes.  The first key should be a primary identifier
of genes in the loaded data.  This could be UID or some current annotation field.
The other key represents a column from the annotation file to be used as a key identifier.
<br><br>
These two keys are used to map or associate annotation from the file to the proper gene in the loaded
data set.  It is not imperative that all loaded genes be present in the annoation file and it
is possible that the annotation file could have many more indices than those found in the data set.
Genes that are not found in the input annotation file will have empty annotation for the imported annotation fields.
</p>

<h2>Gene Identifier</h2>
This drop down list contains the gene annotation types currently loaded.  Use the drop down list
to indicate the key to use to map genes to annotation.

<h2>Corresponding Gene Identifier from Input File</h2>
This drop down list contains gene annotation fields from the input file.  Use the list to select
a key to use to map annotation to genes.  Note that in order to append annotation the two selected
keys should represent overlaping lists of annoation.  During the import these two keys are used to
matche annotation to genes.

<h2>Fields to Append</h2>
This lowest section of the dialog is used to select annotation fields to import.  By default, UID, R, and C,
fields are not selected if present.  At least one field should be selected for import.
