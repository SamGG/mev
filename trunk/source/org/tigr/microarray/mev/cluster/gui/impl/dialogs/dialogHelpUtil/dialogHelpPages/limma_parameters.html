LIMMA, a new module to MeV 4.5, is a technique for identifying differentially expressed genes based off of the fitting of each gene 
to a linear model.  
This method can be applied to a number of experimental designs such as single class, two or more groups, factorial and time-course experiments.
<h3>Running LIMMA:</h3>
After opening the LIMMA initialization dialog, select the type of data you intend to run the analysis on.  Your options are:<br>
1.)  One Class: Only one group is to be evaluated.<br>
2.)  Two Class: The data exists as two groups, and differential expression is to be found between the two groups.<br>
3.)  Multi-Class: The data exists as multiple groups, and differential expression is to be found between the groups.  <br>
Enter the number of groups in the visible field.<br>
4.) Two-factor:  The data will be evaluated to find genes that vary significantly across levels of two independent variables.<br>
Enter factor names, without spaces, and the number of levels for each factor.<br>
5.) Time-course: The data exists as two separate conditions taken at specific intervals of time.<br>
Enter the number of time points in your data.<br>
<br>
Assign a significance level.  Genes with a p-value less than alpha will be deemed significant.<br>

<br>
Assign your samples:<br>
Depending on the type of data you have selected, you will need to assign your samples to groups, factors or time-points, if necessary.<br>
<br>
Button Selection:<br>
Use this option if you have not created clusters for your samples and want to assign each sample individually.<br>
Each group must contain at least two samples assigned to it.  For factorial and time-course data, each combination of levels in 
factor A and factor B must contain at least 2 samples.  
<br><br>
For example: if an experiment has 3 levels for factor “age” (<40, 40-55, >55) and 2 levels for factor “sex” (male, female).  
There must be at least two samples in each of the following:<br>
<h4>1.) <40, male<br>
2.) <40, female<br>
3.) 40-55, male<br>
4.) 40-55, female<br>
5.) >55, male<br>
6.) >55, female<br></h4>
<br>
Cluster Selection:<br>
Use the cluster selection panel if you have previously made clusters and wish to run your analysis based on those clusters.  
Use the drop-down boxes to choose which clusters’ samples are to be assigned to which time-points.  For clusters you are not 
using, leave “unassigned”.  The same condition and time-point requirements exist for this method, but the cluster selector makes 
for easier and more organized sample assignment.
 <br><br>
Hierarchical Clustering:<br>
To have LIMMA construct hierarchical trees for your results, check the corresponding check box.  Select whether this feature is to be 
applied to significant genes or significant and non-significant genes.  This process may add significantly to the computation time.
<br><br>
The LIMMA module outputs standard viewers and tables for MeV’s statistics analyses.<br>
