	<h1>Automatic Identifier List Import Dialog</h1> <h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<p> The Import Dialog is used to import gene or experiment identifiers for the
purpose of imposing or creating clusters within the loaded data set.  This enables the
user to mark genes or experiments of interest for tracking during analysis.</p>

<h2>Import Parameters</h2>
Select one or more annotation type from the left list and click the '>>>' button to move it to the 
list of annotations to be used.
<br>
The annotations types that you have selected will be used to create clusters.  Each unique annotation 
in each annotation type will be used to create a distinct cluster.  Only samples (or genes) that have 
identical annotations for the specified type will be placed in the same cluster.
