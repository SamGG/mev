	<h1>Iterative Linear Regression Normalization</h1><h2>Parameter Information</h2>
            <hr size = 10>

<h2>Normalization Mode</h2>
There are two possible normalization modes available. 
<h3>Block mode</h3> 
Block mode selects to traverse the
data block by block and performs the normalization within each block.
Using this mode data variation between blocks is ignored.
<h3>Global Mode</h3>
Using this mode all data enters into one global normalization.  In this
mode the normalization of all data points is influenced by all other data points
regardless of block membership.

<h2>Standard Deviation Range</h2>
On each iteration a linear regression is calculated for log(Cy5) vs. log(Cy3) based on
a subset of the data.  Initially this subset is the entire data set.
On each iteration points which fall outside the number of standard deviations indicated 
from the regression line are omitted for the next iteration.  On each subsequent
iteration the R<sup>2</sup> is taken until it converges and for each iteration the data set 
for this regression is reduced by selecting only points which fall within the provided 
standard deviation range.
